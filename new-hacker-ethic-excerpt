Bias in computer systems exists because every computer program is by
necessity written from a particular point of view. So what I tell my
students in introductory programming classes is this: programming is
forgetting. And this is both a methodology and a warning.

The process of computer programming is taking the world, which is
infinitely variable, mysterious, and unknowable (if youâ€™ll excuse
a little turn towards the woo in this talk) and turning it into
procedures and data. And we have a number of different names for this
process: scanning, sampling, digitizing, transcribing, schematizing,
programming. But the result is the same. The world, which consists of
analog phenomena infinite and unknowable, is reduced to the repeatable
and the discrete.

In the process of programming, or scanning or sampling or digitizing or
transcribing, much of the world is left out or forgotten. Programming is
an attempt to get a handle on a small part of the world so we can analyze
and reason about it. But a computer program is never itself the world.
